 The front-end is built with Angular, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface. The back-end is implemented using Spring Boot, handling the application logic, data management, and integration with Stripe for secure payment processing.

## Features

- **Checkout**: Proceed to the checkout process, powered by Stripe.
- **Secure Payments**: Integrate with Stripe for secure online payments using credit/debit cards.
- **Order Management**: Process orders and handle payment confirmations.
